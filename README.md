# FitBeat Depresso's AI

Model for mood score's prediction

## How it works at this moment: 
- This RNN model will take your avarage time in bed and predict if you are stressful. For example, if you go to bed too late than usual in some days, this might mean you are stressful.

## Further development: 
- Examine on other features like calories intake, calories burn, steps, heart rate to determine stress level. 

## Notices:
